# install_drupal
A very simple shell script to download Drupal.

I could use the drush, but there're three reasons why not:

1. Drush command line download does not provide download progress. You haven't a way to now the download speed, when it finish or even if the command hals.

2. The Drush way downloads all files with no compression, what means a unnecessary lose of time.

3. (Most important): Reinventing the wheel always is fun!
